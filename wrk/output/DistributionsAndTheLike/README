check_track is relatively recent.  It looks at the nfvtxt distributions for the different small systems.
It also looks at the central trigger enhancement.

makedo is rather old and not needed, but worth having around.  It makes nfvtxt distributions from TProfiles,
which is a rather circuitous way of doing it, but I didn't have the TH1D histograms at the time.

go_frac_yourself is also old, and I don't know where the histograms files went.  It's for looking at the
double interaction contribution to the pAu, which we resolved at some point.
